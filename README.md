Post-Translational Modification (PTM) is a critical biological reaction which adds to diversification the proteome. With numerous known modification being studied, pupylation has gain focus in the scientific community due to its significant role in regulating biological processes. The traditional experimental practice to detect pupylation sites proved to be expensive and requires a lot of time and resources. Thus, there has been many computational predictors developed to challenge this issue, however, performance are still limited. In this study, we propose another computational method named PupStruct which uses the structural information of amino acids with polynomial based kernel function SVM to predict pupylated lysine residues. We compared PupStruct with three state-of-the-art predictors from literature where PupStruct has validated significant improvement in performance over them with statistical metrics such as sensitivity (0.8347), specificity (0. 9312), accuracy (0.8834), precision (0.9242) and Mathewâ€™s correlation coefficient (0.7760) on a benchmark dataset.

You may use this codes to run and compare any new pupylation site prediction with your method
